## Current Task: Implement Dark Theme

This is the plan to switch the website to a dark theme.

1.  **Modify `style.css`:**
    *   Update the root color variables to a dark theme palette.
    *   Adjust the background colors of the body, header, sections, cards, and footer.
    *   Change text colors to ensure high contrast and readability against the dark backgrounds.
    *   Update border and box-shadow colors to fit the dark aesthetic.
